/** Crew Mode workers grouped the way the person reads them: a tool approval only

 *  is finished.
 *
 *  A worker never asks the person itself: its questions and blockers go to its
 *  conductor (`with_conductor`), which answers or asks in its own chat. The one
 *  thing a conductor cannot answer is a tool approval (`approval`), resolved on
 *  the conductor's approval card. The rule is the server's (`crew_workers._group`),
 *  from real signals only (a closed tab, the worker's ledger item, an open
 *  approval), never from "it has replied". The session list's ghost stack and
 *  "Approval needed" / "Done x/y" line, the breadcrumb and the side panel's cards
 *  all read the server's group. A live slot row alone cannot say a worker
 *  finished, so its mirror (`crewWorkerGroupOfRow`) has no done. */
