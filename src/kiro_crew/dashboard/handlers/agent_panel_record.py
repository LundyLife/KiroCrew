"""The record door: ``POST /api/agent-panel/dashboard/record``.

A script cron bound to a crewmate hands the gateway one record -- a type name and an
object -- and the gateway appends it to that crewmate's own DM session log as ONE
``dashboard/custom_value`` entry, stamped with who wrote it. The ``custom`` fold keeps
the latest record per type, so a Dashboard page bound to
``custom.latest.<type>.data`` redraws when the record lands, with no model turn.

Modelled on the Issue Radar ledger's path (``crew_store_log.py``): one registered entry
type, appended gateway-side through :mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.emit`, provenance stamped
by the gateway. What the caller may say is the record's TYPE and DATA; who wrote it,
for whom, and the envelope ``src`` are the gateway's to say and are never read from
the body.

WHO MAY WRITE through THIS route is decided in one place, :func:`_resolve_record_writer`,
and the answer is a script cron bound to a member and nothing else. An app-token caller
is turned away by the same ``_deny_app_caller`` every member route uses: an installed
app writes through its own door, ``POST /api/member-records/{slug}``
(:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.agent_panel_record_app`), which resolves the app as the
writer and then hands the record to the same :func:`record_through_door` this route
uses -- one append, one quota, one fold, two resolvers.

:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.agent_panel` is this module's facade: callers and
tests import and patch every name through it (:mod:`kiro_crew._facade_mirror`). This
module never imports the facade.
