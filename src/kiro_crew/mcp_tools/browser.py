"""The ``browser`` tool: run one operation in the agent's browser.

``schemas()`` is the ADVERTISEMENT half (name, model-facing description, the
JSON Schema a call is validated against) and ``HANDLERS`` maps the name to the
function that runs it. Both halves live here so the contract and the behavior
read together, and ``test_mcp_tool_registry`` fails if one arrives without the
other.

The browser itself is the Browser Harness the gateway supervises
(``browser_harness/``), reached over the gateway's own CDP relay. This tool is
its agent-facing SUBMIT side only: ``kirocrew-core`` is a separate stdio shim, so
the handler cannot reach the supervisor in-process. It POSTs one op to the
gateway route ``/api/browser/op`` over loopback with the internal-secret
handshake, the same shape ``mcp_computer`` uses, and the gateway runs it through
``browser_harness.ops``. The tool holds NO state: the ref map lives in the page,
the tab ledger in the relay, the input lock in the gateway.

Two gates run HERE, before anything is posted, and they fail in opposite
directions on purpose:

* **Governance** (``capabilities.browse``): a denial refuses OUTRIGHT. There is
  no other browser to fall back to, and there must not be one, or the control
  would not control anything.
* **The navigate gate**: only a public http(s) URL, or a loopback ``host:port``
  the OPERATOR listed in ``dashboard.browser_local_origins``, is ever opened.
  Everything else (loopback, private, link-local, the cloud metadata address, a
  parser-differential spelling) is refused, because those are where the user's
  own control planes live, this dashboard included. The same gate covers the
  URL a new tab opens with.

Availability is the gateway's to report, not this process's to probe: a host
with no Harness answers ``not_installed`` and the tool says so. The tool is
always advertised because kiro-cli caches ``tools/list`` for a session's life,
so an install made mid-session is picked up on the next call.
