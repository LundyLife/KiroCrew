"""Shell assignment readings: the guarded-reassignment resolver and its budget.

The resolver behind :func:`.shell_normalizer._resolve_local_assignments`: one token
list per reading of a command's guarded reassignments, the co-reference grouping
that decides which choices are enumerated together, the reading budget one payload
walk shares, the fail-closed reading a group past that budget reads as, and the
glued-carrier binding table.  The leaf syntax it reads is
:mod:`.shell_assignment_syntax`; the program and verb recognisers are read late
through :mod:`.shell_normalizer`, so a patch on the reader reaches this module too.
Split out of the reader to hold it under the per-file line cap.

    Only LITERAL right-hand sides are tracked, and only assignments that appear in
    this same command text -- there is no attempt to model the ambient environment.
    That is enough for the evasion it closes, where the attacker must supply both
    halves themselves.

    A value that REFERENCES an already-tracked variable is expanded before it is
    classified, so a name assembled across several assignments still resolves to the
    literal the shell will run.

    A guarded reassignment of any tracked binding (``x=<cli> && x=bash; $x -c ...``,
    ``v=<verb>; false && v=doctor; <cli> $v``) is read both ways: the guard may skip
    the new value, so the prior still runs, and
    the new value may be a shell whose payload the walk must still descend.  One
    resolved frame carries one program per use, so each further reading is a further
    token list (the first is the command as written).  Each guarded reassignment is
    its own choice: two of them
    read only all-prior and all-new missed ``x=<cli>; false && x=echo; v=doctor;
    true && v=<verb>; $x $v``, which runs the mint (found in review).  Choices
    under two guards SPELLED alike are not one choice either: the text is
    case-folded before it is read, so ``$Path`` and ``$PATH`` are one name here
    and two in bash, and a command between the two tests can rewrite what they
    read; tying them folded away the mixed reading that pairs the prior program
    with the new verb (found in review).  A choice on a
    name that is never expanded again changes no reading and is not enumerated.
    The rest are enumerated as the FULL product within each group of names that
    are expanded in one simple command (:func:`_co_referenced_names`) -- a
    frame's argv is one segment, so choices on names that never meet in a segment
    cannot pair, and enumerating their product bought nothing.  Capping the
    product and folding the choices past the cap onto one shared bit was a
    bypass: three filler guards pushed the program and the verb choices onto the
    shared bit, whose all-prior and all-new readings never pair the prior program
    with the new verb (found in review).  So a group past
    :data:`_GUARDED_READING_CAP` choices is not folded: its reading is the
    fail-closed :data:`_UNREADABLE_GUARDED_READING`, exactly as a regex group
    past its budget reads as ``.*``; so is a group whose readings would expand to
    more than :data:`_GUARDED_READING_VOLUME` of text.  The budget is spent by
    the COMMAND, not by each group: every further reading is one more full
    rescan of the token list, and one group per simple command bounds the
    group count only by the command's length, so 300 one-choice groups under
    the scan ceiling each passed the per-group check and together held the
    loop past its watchdog (found in review).  Past
    ``2 ** _GUARDED_READING_CAP`` readings in all, or past the volume budget
    in all, the command reads as the fail-closed reading and enumeration stops.
